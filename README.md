# Getting Started
1. Clone Repo
2. Run yarn install 
3. Once you have ran yarn install, install nvm and run the command `nvm use` to make sure you are using the version of node I have specified in the package.json and .nvmrc file
4. If you don't already have TSLint Plugin, install the TSLint plugin in vscode. That should work with the TS settings we have configured in the tsconfig.json file

# Scripts
`yarn storybook` will run the storybook UI library so you can have a playground for the components in the components/UI directory. Customize your UI components as you see fit
